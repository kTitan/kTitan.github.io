      <title>Howto disable easy-adsenser if wptouch is active</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WpTouch is a great plugin, if you want to optimize your wordpress blog for mobile content. It also comes with an integrated adsense option for the mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course much better then the normal google ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now comes the problem: In my blogs i often use easy-adsenser as the adsense mangement software. But if this is active, and you also activate the adsense option in WpTouch you will see ALL ads in the mobile view (the one from WpTouch and the one(s) from easy-adsenser). This can also be perhaps against the terms of google, depending how you setup easy-adsenser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked a bit around in the code and found an easy we how to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I wanted just set up my new blog and use a permalink structure like this:
/%category%/%postname%/ The strange thing was that it want work. mod_rewrite is enabled from my hoster, other sites work with it without any problems. If I used a structure with the &amp;ldquo;index.php&amp;rdquo; in it, it worked without any problem. I googled a lot and read very much of the docu. Most of them only say, that the mod_rewrite, followsymlinks, and such things have to be enabled.</description>
