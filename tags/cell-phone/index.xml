      <description>&lt;p&gt;There many reasons why you want to disable the itunes auto sync with the connected devices. My reason was that, I wanted to be sure, that I always have a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; working backup on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if you have mistakenly deleted/changed some importent settings on you phone and then want to recover them via sync? Yes you connect the iPhone to your pc, and iTunes automatically sync you wrong data from the phone to the pc. Of course you can stop this, if you are fast enough. But isnÂ´t it better to be sure to donÂ´t have this problem?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Useful for example, if you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have formatted your pc without backup of your iTunes folder&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>UIQ3 cell phone as modem via usb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my new Sony Ericsson P1i a few weeks ago. Because I hate it to use Windows I wanted to get it working as an usb modem under linux. In my case again under gentoo ðŸ˜‰ My cell phone provider in Germany is Eplus. So if you use this with an other provider you will have to change some values of course. The cell phone itself has SymbianOS on it. The version its called UIQ3. The instructions should work for all QUI3 phones, as far as I know. I used very much sites to get this together, so I beg your pardon that I forgot which that all was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first check if you have the need kernel options enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
