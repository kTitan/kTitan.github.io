      <description>I wanted just set up my new blog and use a permalink structure like this:
/%category%/%postname%/ The strange thing was that it want work. mod_rewrite is enabled from my hoster, other sites work with it without any problems. If I used a structure with the &amp;ldquo;index.php&amp;rdquo; in it, it worked without any problem. I googled a lot and read very much of the docu. Most of them only say, that the mod_rewrite, followsymlinks, and such things have to be enabled.</description>
