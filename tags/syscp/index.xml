      <title>Syscp to Froxlor Upgrade Guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Howto I will do an upgrade from syscp 1.4.2.1 to the fork froxlor in the current revision of 0.9.3. I hope to cover all fall sticks. But overall the upgrade is very painless and easy. Thanks a lot to guys of froxlor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this as always on a gentoo host. Its your choice to use the good ebuild to install froxlor or to download it by hand. Here I will cover the manual steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First start with the basic stuff (download, uncompress, &amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a short note for everyone who still deals with syscp as their server management software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you all with have recognized, that there was long time no update of syscp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have followed the development commits, or the forum you will have noticed the main reason: The most active developers has left the project long ago, and now the leader is totally alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok that was the bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good newsÂ  is, that many of the former developers has now build a fork named &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.froxlor.org/&#34;&gt;froxlor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They already has published some bugfix releases and currently they are working on a clean rewrite with a good framework. So lets see what the future will bring. But I am already preparing my host to be migrated to froxlor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>syscp with libnss-mysql</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After installing a new rootserver with syscp, I decided to also install libnss-mysql support on the system. The advantage is, that it is easy to see which file belongs to which user. I hate to only see the uids and gids ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I use gentoo on the server, I emerged libnss-mysql. If you use an other distribution, you have to install it with your package manager if it is available. I used version 1.5 of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was a bit tricky to find the right config for syscp for it. After a long search and many tries now it works good. Here are my configs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
