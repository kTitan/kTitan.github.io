title: syscp with libnss-mysql

After installing a new rootserver with syscp, I decided to also install libnss-mysql support on the system. The advantage is, that it is easy to see which file belongs to which user. I hate to only see the uids and gids ðŸ˜‰

Because I use gentoo on the server, I emerged libnss-mysql. If you use an other distribution, you have to install it with your package manager if it is available. I used version 1.5 of it.

Now it was a bit tricky to find the right config for syscp for it. After a long search and many tries now it works good. Here are my configs:

/etc/libnss-mysql-root.cfg:

{{< highlight text >}}
> username syscp
> password SYSCPPASSWORD
{{< /highlight >}}

/etc/libnss-mysql.cfg

{{< highlight text >}}
> getpwnam SELECT username,'x',uid,gid,username,homedir,shell \
> FROM ftp_users \
> WHERE username='%1$s' \
> LIMIT 1
> getpwuid SELECT username,'x',uid,gid,username,homedir,shell \
> FROM ftp_users \
> WHERE uid='%1$u' \
> LIMIT 1
> getpwent SELECT username,'x',uid,gid,username,homedir,shell \
> FROM ftp_users

Now it would be good to also use this ;). So you have to change /etc/nsswitch.conf like this:

{{< highlight text >}}
> passwd: compat mysql
> shadow: compat mysql
> group: compat mysql
{{< /highlight >}}

If you use the nscd don't forget to restart it!

And that was it already ðŸ˜‰
