      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my new Sony Ericsson P1i a few weeks ago. Because I hate it to use Windows I wanted to get it working as an usb modem under linux. In my case again under gentoo ðŸ˜‰ My cell phone provider in Germany is Eplus. So if you use this with an other provider you will have to change some values of course. The cell phone itself has SymbianOS on it. The version its called UIQ3. The instructions should work for all QUI3 phones, as far as I know. I used very much sites to get this together, so I beg your pardon that I forgot which that all was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first check if you have the need kernel options enabled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>syscp with libnss-mysql</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After installing a new rootserver with syscp, I decided to also install libnss-mysql support on the system. The advantage is, that it is easy to see which file belongs to which user. I hate to only see the uids and gids ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I use gentoo on the server, I emerged libnss-mysql. If you use an other distribution, you have to install it with your package manager if it is available. I used version 1.5 of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was a bit tricky to find the right config for syscp for it. After a long search and many tries now it works good. Here are my configs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
